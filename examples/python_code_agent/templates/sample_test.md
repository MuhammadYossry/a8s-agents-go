## 1. Basic Formatting with a Twist

Hey there! 👋 Let's explore some awesome markdown features. You'll love these! 

Here's what makes text stand out:
- **Bold statements** make an impact
- *Italic whispers* add emphasis
- ~~Strikethrough~~ when you change your mind
- ==Highlighted text== for important points

## 2. Code Blocks with Style

### JavaScript with Syntax Highlighting
```javascript
const greeting = (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}! 👋`);
  return {
    message: 'Welcome to our demo',
    timestamp: new Date()
  };
};
```

### Python Magic
```python
def calculate_happiness(coffee_cups: int) -> str:
    return "🎉 " * coffee_cups + "Happiness Level: Maximum!"
```

## 3. Math Equations (LaTeX Support)

Need to show some fancy math? We've got you covered!
