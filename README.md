# AI Task Routing System

## Project Overview

The AI Task Routing System is a flexible and scalable architecture designed to efficiently match incoming task requests with the most suitable AI agents. This system allows for precise task allocation based on AI capabilities, clear communication of requirements, and consideration of ethical and privacy concerns.

## Key Features

1. Precise matching of tasks to AI agent capabilities
2. Clear communication of task requirements and expectations
3. Consideration of ethical and privacy concerns
4. Easy updating and versioning of task definitions

## System Architecture

### 1. Task Registry

- Centralized repository for AI services to publish their task definitions
- Supports role-based CRUD operations for task definitions
- Implements versioning to track changes over time

### 2. Service Discovery

- Allows AI agents to advertise their capabilities by registering task definitions
- Implements a distributed key-value store or dedicated service registry (e.g., etcd, Consul)

### 3. Task Routing

- Matches incoming task requests to the most suitable AI agent
- Considers factors like required capabilities, constraints, and performance metrics

### 4. API Gateway

- Serves as the entry point for task requests
- Validates incoming requests against task definitions

### 5. Load Balancing

- Distributes tasks among multiple AI agent instances
- Considers current load and performance metrics

### 6. Monitoring and Logging

- Tracks AI agent performance against advertised metrics
- Captures task execution details for auditing and system improvement

### 7. Version Management

- Manages different versions of task definitions and AI agent implementations
- Supports running multiple versions concurrently and phasing out older versions

### 8. Error Handling

- Implements robust mechanisms for AI agent failures, input validation errors, and timeouts
- Defines clear error responses adhering to task definition output schemas

## Task Definition Schema

The system uses a comprehensive schema for defining AI tasks. Here's a simplified version:

```json
{
  "aiTaskDefinition": {
    "taskId": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "description": "string",
    "version": "string",
    "inputFormat": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {}
    },
    "outputFormat": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {}
    },
    "contextRequirements": ["string"],
    "skillsRequired": ["string"],
    "domainKnowledge": ["string"],
    "languageCapabilities": ["string"],
    "complexityLevel": "string",
    "estimatedResponseTime": "string",
    "privacyLevel": "string",
    "ethicalConsiderations": ["string"],
    "examplePrompts": ["string"],
    "failureModes": ["string"],
    "updateFrequency": "string",
    "tags": ["string"]
  }
}
```

## Example Task Definitions

The repository includes example task definitions for:

1. [Multi-modal Content Analysis and Generation](examples/tasks/multi_modal_content_analysis.json)
2. [Text Summarization](examples/tasks/text_summarization.json)
3. [Text Sentiment Analysis](examples/tasks/sentiment_analysis.json)

These examples demonstrate how various AI services can advertise their capabilities using the defined schema.

## Implementation Steps

1. Create a central registry for AI agents to publish task definitions
2. Develop an API for services to register, update, and query task definitions
3. Implement a task routing system to match requests with suitable AI services

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with popular AI frameworks and platforms
- Development of a user interface for task submission and monitoring
- Implementation of advanced routing algorithms using machine learning
